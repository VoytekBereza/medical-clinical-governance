    <p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>

    <p>Any extension to professional roles with regard to administration and supply of medicines must take into account the need to protect patient safety, ensure continuity of care and safeguard patient choice and convenience. It also has to be cost-effective and bring demonstrable benefits to patient care.</p>

    <p>This patient group direction (PGD) will increase patient care in the area of travel medicine as there will be a specialised travel medicine professional handling all consultations. This PGD has been created with the aim of providing an efficient, effective, accessible travel health service to patients.</p>

    <p>This PGD is designed to guide pharmacists on the supply of mefloquine (Lariam) to patients requiring malaria prophylaxis for travel purposes. Mefloquine is an alternative to Malarone (atovaquone/proguanil) or Doxycycline for the prophylaxis of malaria.</p>

    <p>Four steps remain essential to prevent damage to health due to malaria in UK travellers:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>A</strong>wareness: know about the risk of malaria.</li>
        <li><strong>B</strong>ites by mosquitoes: prevent or avoid.</li>
        <li><strong>C</strong>ompliance with appropriate <strong>C</strong>hemoprophylaxis.</li>
        <li><strong>D</strong>iagnose breakthrough malaria swiftly and obtain treatment promptly. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Recent guidelines give greater emphasis to the importance of balancing the risk of malaria and the risk of adverse reactions to antimalarials.</p>

    <p>PGDs do not remove inherent professional obligations or accountability. It is the responsibility of each professional to practice only within the bounds of their own competence.</p>

    <p class="p1"><span class="s1">This PGD relates to two counterpart documents entitled:</span></p>

    <ul class="ul1">
        <li class="li2"><span class="s1">"Travel Risk Assessment Form" termed "tRAF" throughout the </span>https://hubnet.io/ <span class="s1"> website.</span></li>
        <li class="li2"><span class="s1">“Malaria Risk Assessment Form" termed “mRAF" throughout the </span>https://hubnet.io/ <span class="s1"> website</span></li>
    </ul>

    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This PGD will be reviewed annually, by the authorising clinicians, to ensure that it reflects contemporary guidance.</strong></span>
        <br />
    </p>

    <p><strong>2. Clinical decision making</strong>
        <br />

    <p> </p>

    <p><strong>2.5 Actions for patients who do not wish to receive care under this PGD</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>The patient should be advised of the risks of malaria in the region being visited and given advice on bite avoidance and the signs and symptoms of malaria infection.</li>
        <li>Document advice given.</li>
        <li>Document refusal in notes.</li>
        <li>Seek medical advice if necessary</li>
    </ul>

    <p> </p>

    <p><strong>2.6 Precautions and special warnings</strong></p>

    <p>No antimalarial drug provides 100% protection even if used strictly according to the recommendations. Malaria drugs reduce the risk of infection with around 80% to 95% depending on your destination and living conditions. Travellers should be told about the importance of avoiding mosquito bites, the importance of taking prophylaxis regularly and the importance of an immediate visit to their doctor if they fall ill within one year and especially within three months.</p>

    <p><strong>Pregnancy</strong> - the manufacturer advises that adequate contraception during prophylaxis and for three months after stopping (teratogenicity in animal studies).</p>

    <p>Mefloquine is considered not to be the drug of choice for SCUBA holidays.</p>

    <p style="font-family: Times;"><strong>Interaction with vaccines</strong></p>

    <p style="font-family: Times;">When mefloquine is taken concurrently with oral live typhoid vaccines, attenuation of immunization cannot be excluded. Vaccinations with attenuated live bacteria should therefore, be completed at least 3 days before the first dose of mefloquine.</p>

    <p><strong style="font-family: Times;">Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions</strong></p>

    <p>Mefloquine may induce psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety disorders, paranoia, depression, hallucinations and psychosis. Psychiatric symptoms such as nightmares, acute anxiety, depression, restlessness or confusion have to be regarded as prodromal for a more serious event. Cases of suicide, suicidal thoughts and self-endangering behaviour such as attempted suicide have been reported.</p>

    <p><span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 12px;">Cases of polyneuropathy </span><span style="font-family: Times;">(based on neurological</span><span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 12px;"> symptoms</span><span style="font-family: Times;"> s</span><span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 12px;">uch as pain, </span><span style="font-family: Times;">burning, sensory disturbances or muscle weakness, alone or in combination) have been reported in patients receiving mefloquine. Mefloquine should be discontinued in patients experiencing symptoms of neuropathy, including pain, burning, tingling, numbness, and/or weakness in order to prevent the development of an irreversible </span><span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 12px;">condition.</span></p>

    <p>Patients on malaria chemoprophylaxis with mefloquine should be informed that if these reactions or changes to their mental state occur during mefloquine use, to stop taking mefloquine and seek medical advice immediately so that mefloquine can be replaced by alternative malaria prevention medication.</p>

    <p>Due to the long half-life of mefloquine, adverse reactions may occur and persist up to several months after discontinuation of the drug. In a small number of patients it has been reported that dizziness or vertigo and loss of balance continued for months after discontinuation of the drug. To minimise the risk of these adverse reactions, mefloquine must not be used for chemoprophylaxis in patients with active or a history of psychiatric disturbances such as depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia or other psychiatric disorders.</p>

    <p><strong>Cardiac toxicity</strong></p>

    <p>Concomitant administration of mefloquine and other related compounds (e.g. quinine, quinidine and chloroquine) may produce electrocardiographic abnormalities. Due to the risk of a potentially fatal prolongation of the QTc interval, halofantrine must not be used during mefloquine chemoprophylaxis or treatment of malaria, or within 15 weeks after the last dose of mefloquine. Due to increased plasma concentrations and elimination half-life of mefloquine following co-administration with ketoconazole, the risk of QTc prolongation may also be expected if ketoconazole is taken during mefloquine chemoprophylaxis or treatment of malaria, or within 15 weeks after the last dose of mefloquine. Patients should be advised to consult a doctor, if signs of arrhythmia or palpitations occur during chemoprophylaxis with mefloquine. These symptoms might, in rare cases, precede severe cardiologic side effects.</p>

    <p style="font-family: Times;"><strong>Seizure disorders</strong></p>

    <p>Concomitant administration of mefloquine and anticonvulsants (e.g. valproic acid, carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin) may reduce seizure control by lowering the plasma levels of anticonvulsant. Therefore, patients concurrently taking anti-seizure medication, including valproic acid, carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin, and mefloquine should have the blood level of their anti-seizure medication monitored and the dosage adjusted as necessary. Concomitant administration of mefloquine and drugs known to lower the epileptogenic threshold (antidepressants such as tricyclic or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); bupropion; antipsychotics; tramadol; chloroquine or some antibiotics) may increase the risk of convulsions.</p>

    <p><b>Geographical drug resistance</b></p>

    <p><span style="font-size: 11px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Geographical drug resistance patterns of P. falciparum occur and preferred choice of malaria chemoprophylaxis might be different from one area to another. Resistance of </span><i style="font-size: 11px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">P. falciparum</i><span style="font-size: 11px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> to mefloquine has been reported, predominantly in areas of multi-drug resistance in South-East Asia. Cross-resistance between mefloquine and halofantrine and cross-resistance between mefloquine and quinine have been observed in some regions. For current advice on geographical resistance patterns competent national expert centres should be consulted.</span></p>

    <p><strong>Eye disorders</strong></p>

    <p>Any patient presenting with a visual disorder should be referred to a physician as certain conditions (such as retinal disorders or optic neuropathy) may require stopping treatment with mefloquine.</p>

    <p><strong>Impaired liver function</strong></p>

    <p>In patients with impaired liver function, the elimination of mefloquine may be prolonged, leading to higher plasma levels and a higher risk of adverse reactions.</p>

    <p><strong>Pneumonitis</strong></p>

    <p>Pneumonitis of possible allergic aetiology has been reported in patients receiving mefloquine. Patients who develop signs of dyspnoea, dry cough or fever etc. while receiving mefloquine should be advised to contact a doctor to undergo medical evaluation.</p>

    <p><strong>Inhibitors and Inducers of CYP3A4</strong></p>

    <p>Inhibitors and Inducers of the isoenzyme CYP3A4 may modify the pharmacokinetics/metabolism of mefloquine, leading to an increase or decrease in mefloquine plasma concentrations.</p>

    <p><strong style="font-family: Times;">Interaction with vaccines</strong></p>

    <p>When mefloquine is taken concurrently with oral live typhoid vaccines, attenuation of immunisation cannot be excluded. Vaccinations with oral attenuated live bacteria should therefore, be completed at least 3 days before the first dose of mefloquine.</p>

    <p style="font-family: Times;"><strong>Hypoglycaemia</strong></p>

    <p style="margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 4px 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="font-size:11px;">The possibility of hypoglycaemia in patients with congenital hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia should be considered. Patients should not disregard the possibility that re-infection or recrudescence may occur after effective antimalarial therapy.</span></p>

    <p style="font-family: Times;"><b>Galactose intolerance </b></p>

    <p style="font-family: Times;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.</span></p>

    <p><strong>Long term use</strong></p>

    <p>During clinical trials, this drug was not administered for longer than one year. If the drug is to be administered for a prolonged period, periodic evaluations including liver function tests and periodic ophthalmic examinations should be performed.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p><strong>2.7 Concurrent medication</strong></p>

    <p>The patient should understand to inform the pharmacist via the Travel information form if you take other medications also non-prescription drugs. Drug-drug interactions with mefloquine have not been explored in detail. There is one report of cardiopulmonary arrest, with full recovery, in a patient who was taking a beta blocker (propranolol). The effects of mefloquine on the compromised cardiovascular system have not been evaluated. The benefits of mefloquine therapy should be weighed against the possibility of adverse effects in patients with cardiac disease.</p>

    <p>Because of the danger of a potentially fatal prolongation of the QTc interval, halofantrine must not be given simultaneously with or subsequent to mefloquine.</p>

    <p>Concomitant administration of mefloquine and other related compounds (eg, quinine, quinidine and chloroquine) may produce electrocardiographic abnormalities and increase the risk of convulsions. If these drugs are to be used in the initial treatment of severe malaria, mefloquine administration should be delayed at least 12 hours after the last dose. There is evidence that the use of halofantrine after mefloquine causes a significant lengthening of the QTc interval. Clinically significant QTc prolongation has not been found with mefloquine alone.</p>

    <p>This appears to be the only clinically relevant interaction of this kind with mefloquine, although theoretically, coadministration of other drugs known to alter cardiac conduction (eg, anti-arrhythmic or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, antihistamines or H1-blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines) might also contribute to a prolongation of the QTc interval. There are no data that conclusively establish whether the concomitant administration of mefloquine and the above listed agents has an effect on cardiac function.</p>

    <p>In patients taking an anticonvulsant (eg, valproic acid, carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin), the concomitant use of mefloquine may reduce seizure control by lowering the plasma levels of the anticonvulsant. Therefore, patients concurrently taking antiseizure medication and mefloquine should have the blood level of their antiseizure medication monitored and the dosage adjusted appropriately.</p>

    <p>When mefloquine is taken concurrently with oral live typhoid vaccines, attenuation of immunisation cannot be excluded. Vaccinations with attenuated live bacteria should therefore, be completed at least 3 days before the first dose of mefloquine.</p>

    <p><strong>4. Description of Treatment Available Under this Direction</strong></p>

    <p><strong>4.1 Mefloquine Tablets</strong></p>

    <p>Each mefloquine tablet for oral administration contains 250mg of mefloquine (please check specific pack for extra excipient such as lactose). The Branded white scored “Larium” additionally contains excipients: poloxamer, microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, maize starch, crospovidone, ammonium clacium alignate, talc and magnesium stearate.</p>

    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mefloquine is a Prescription-only Medicines (PoM).</strong></span></p>

    <p> </p>

    <p><strong>4.2 Dose, route and frequency</strong></p>

    <p>Prophylaxis of malaria:</p>

    <p>For malaria prophylaxis the stated dose of Lariam should be given once weekly, always on the same day. Treatment should be initiated at least one week and up to 2-3 weeks before arrival in a malarious area and continued for 4 weeks after leaving (minimum treatment period 6 weeks). The maximum recommended duration of administration of Lariam is 12 months.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p><strong>4.3 Duration of treatment available under this PGD</strong></p>

    <p>Mefloquine is licensed to be used for up to 12 months therefore, under the terms of this PGD the maximum duration of treatment is 12 months.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p><strong>4.4 Adverse effects</strong></p>

    <p>Mefloquine is generally well tolerated when used for chemoprophylaxis. Approximately 20% to 30% of travellers will experience side effects from either mefloquine or chloroquine; most of these are mild and self-limiting. The most frequent minor side effects reported with mefloquine use are nausea, strange dreams, dizziness, mood changes, insomnia, headache, and diarrhoea. Approximately 1% to 4% of mefloquine users discontinue prophylaxis because of adverse effects, a rate not significantly different from other chemoprophylaxis regimens.</p>

    <p>Severe neuropsychiatric reactions (psychosis, convulsions) are infrequent with prophylactic doses and are reported to occur in approximately 1/10,000 to 1/13,000 individuals. Less severe but nonetheless troublesome neuro-psychologic adverse events (anxiety, depression, nightmares, etc.) requiring drug discontinuation are reported in less than 1% of users. In treatment with higher doses (25 mg base/kg), mefloquine is less well tolerated and severe neuropsychiatric reactions are reported to be 10 to 60 times more frequent.</p>

    <p>Healthcare professionals are reminded that mefloquine is associated with potentially serious neuropsychiatric reactions and that it is contra-indicated for malaria prophylaxis in those with a history of psychiatric disorders or convulsions. Abnormal dreams, insomnia, anxiety, and depression occur commonly. Psychosis, suicidal ideation, and suicide have also been reported. Psychiatric symptoms such as nightmares, acute anxiety, depression, restlessness, or confusion should be regarded as potentially prodromal for a more serious event. If neuropsychiatric symptoms occur, patients should be advised to discontinue mefloquine and to seek immediate medical attention so that mefloquine can be replaced with an alternative antimalarial. Adverse reactions may occur and persist up to several months after discontinuation because mefloquine has a long half-life</p>

    <p>See the BNF for more information.</p>

    <p><strong>Treatment of overdose</strong></p>

    <p>The patient should be referred for medical attention immediately.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p><strong>4.5 Advice to patient</strong></p>

    <p>The patient should also be advised that it is important to take the tablets at the same time each week and to complete the full course.</p>

    <p>In the event of vomiting within 1 hour of dosing, a repeat dose should be taken and the course continued as before. The patient should obtain more mefloquine tablets to replace those that were vomited.</p>

    <p>The patient information leaflet contained in the medicine(s) should be made accessible to the patient/parent/guardian. Where this is unavailable, or unsuitable, sufficient information should be given to the patient/parent/guardian in a language that they can understand.</p>

    <p>Caution should be exercised with regard to activities requiring alertness and fine motor coordination such as driving, piloting aircraft, operating machinery, as dizziness, vertigo or a loss of balance, or other disorders of the central or peripheral nervous system and psychiatric disorders have been reported during and following the use of mefloquine. These effects may occur after therapy is discontinued due to the long half-life of the drug. In a small number of patients dizziness or vertigo and loss of balance have been reported to continue for months after discontinuation of the drug.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p><strong>4.6 Follow up treatment</strong></p>

    <p>Advise patient if the patient develops a fever upon returning that they should consult their GP as this may be a possible indication of malaria.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p><strong>5. Documentation </strong>
        <br />
        <strong>5.1 Authorisation of administration </strong></p>

    <p><span>In order to use this authorised PGD, permission must be granted from the CQC line manager or pharmacy superintendent, as appropriate. Authorisation to </span><span>supply the medicine specified in</span><span> this PGD is exclusively awarded by the authorising clinicians, upon completion of bespoke training and assessment set out by Voyager Medical. </span></p>

    <p> </p>

    <p><strong>5.2 Record of supply </strong>
        <br /> An electronic or paper record for recording the screening of patients prior to and subsequent to the supply of medicine under this PGD must be completed in order to allow audit of practice. This should include:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Name and address of the patient.</li>
        <li>Date of birth.</li>
        <li>Consultant/General practitioner details.</li>
        <li>Exclusion criteria, record why treatment was not supplied in the RAF notes section.</li>
        <li>The name of the medicine supplied including brand and quantity.</li>
        <li>Signature and name in capital letters of the practitioner who supplied treatment.</li>
        <li>Date the medicine was given.</li>
        <li>Record of adverse effects.</li>
        <li>Signature of the patient.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>A record of the supply must be made. This can either be done electronically on https://hubnet.io/ or into the patient’s case notes.</p>

    <p>For patients aged 18 years and over, retain for 8 years after the conclusion of treatment, or for 3 years after death, or in accordance with local policy, where this is greater than above. If a physical tRAF/mRAF is used, this must be retained on the CQC or GPhC registered premises.</p>

    <p><strong>5.3 Consent </strong></p>

    <p>Prior to the supply of a medicine, consent must be obtained, preferably written, from the patient, and documented either in the patient’s medical records/notes or on an administration form.</p>

    <p>The key points include: -</p>

    <ul>
        <li>If a patient’s fitness and suitability cannot be established, supply should be deferred.</li>
        <li>There is no legal requirement for consent to be in writing but written consent serves to record the decision and the discussions that have taken place.</li>
        <li>Consent - either written or verbal - is required at the time of each supply.</li>
        <li>Consent remains valid unless the individual who gave it withdraws it. If there is new information between the time consent was given and when the supply is offered, including new evidence of risk, new medicines becoming available or where there is a significant change in the individual’s condition, it may be necessary for the patient to reconfirm their consent.</li>
        <li>Written and verbal information should be available in a form that can be easily understood by the person who will be giving the consent. Where English is not easily understood, translations and properly recognised interpreters should be used in order that they can make informed consent.</li>
        <li>The bringing of a patient for the supply after an invitation to attend for this purpose may be viewed as acceptance that the patient may have the administration.</li>
        <li>Individuals (patient, parent, guardian or person with parental responsibility) should also be informed about how data on the supply will be stored, who will be able to access that information and how that data may be used.</li>
        <li>Where consent is either refused or withdrawn, this decision must be documented.</li>
        <li>Consent obtained before the occasion upon which a patient is brought for the supply is only an agreement for the patient to be included in the administration programme and does not mean that consent is in place for each future administration.</li>
    </ul>

    <p> </p>

    <p><strong>5.4 Audit </strong>
        <br /> All health risk assessment, advice, medicine supply record and record of emergency management of anaphylaxis should be stored in the pharmacy or CQC registered business and will be audited by a line manager designated healthcare professional every year, in order to analyse service delivery. Upon reviewing the audit, if the service is deemed insufficient by the line auditor, Voyager Medical must be immediately notified and the CQC manager or superintendent pharmacist must be informed. An action plan to remedy the insufficiencies will then be required to submit to the Voyager Medical medical team for analysis.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p><strong>6. Facilities and supplies to be available at sites for the supply of the drug specified in this PGD</strong>
