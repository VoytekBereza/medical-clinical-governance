    <p><strong>1. Introduction</strong>
        <br /> Any extension to professional roles with regard the supply of medicines must take into account the need to protect patient safety, ensure continuity of care and safeguard patient choice and convenience. It also has to be cost-effective and bring demonstrable benefits to patient care.</p>

    <p>This patient group direction (PGD) will increase patient care in the area of travel medicine as there will be a specialised travel medicine professional handling all consultations. This PGD has been created with the aim of providing an efficient and effective Travel Health Services to Patients.</p>

    <p>This PGD is designed to guide pharmacists on the supply of doxycycline to patients requiring malaria prophylaxis for travel purposes. Doxycycline is a member of the tetracycline antibiotics group and is commonly used to treat a variety of infections. Doxycycline is a semi-synthetic tetracycline invented and clinically developed in the early 1960s. Doxycycline is an alternative to Malarone (atovaquone/proguanil) or Lariam (mefloquine) for the prophylaxis of malaria.</p>

    <p>Four steps remain essential to prevent damage to health due to malaria in UK travellers:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>A</strong>wareness: know about the risk of malaria.</li>
        <li><strong>B</strong>ites by mosquitoes: prevent or avoid.</li>
        <li><strong>C</strong>ompliance with appropriate <strong>C</strong>hemoprophylaxis.</li>
        <li><strong>D</strong>iagnose breakthrough malaria swiftly and obtain treatment promptly.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Recent guidelines give greater emphasis to the importance of balancing the risk of malaria and the risk of adverse reactions to antimalarials.</p>

    <p>PGDs do not remove inherent professional obligations or accountability. It is the responsibility of each professional to practice only within the bounds of their own competence.</p>

    <p>This PGD relates to two counterpart documents entitled:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>"Travel Risk Assessment Form" termed "tRAF" <span>throughout the </span>https://hubnet.io <span> website.</span></li>
        <li>“Malaria Risk Assessment Form" termed “mRAF" throughout the https://hubnet.io website.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This PGD will be reviewed annually, by the authorising clinicians, to ensure that it reflects contemporary guidance.</strong></span>
        <br />
    </p>

    <p><strong>2. Clinical decision making</strong>
        <br />
        <strong>2.1 Inclusion criteria</strong></p>

    </div>

    <p> </p>

    <p><strong>2.2 Patients who may receive the supply of doxycycline</strong>
        <br /> All patients in 2.1 above, who do not want specifically to consult with a doctor and are willing to have treatment from the PGD authorised healthcare professional.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p><strong>2.3 Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>Children under <strong>12 years of age</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Breast feeding</strong> and <strong>pregnant</strong> women.</li>
        <li>The patient is between the ages of 16-18 and not accompanied by a legal guardian unless the pharmacist has undergone a successful Enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS - previously called an enhanced CRB check).</li>
        <li>The patient is under the age of 16 and does not have an accompanying guardian who is legally authorised to consent on the child's behalf.</li>
        <li>Patients who are contraindicated (see proceeding section).</li>
        <li><strong>Absence of valid consent.</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p> </p>

    <p><strong>2.4 Actions to be taken regarding care of excluded patients</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>Doxycycline is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to doxycycline or any component of the formulation. See the current BNF for details. More specifically:
            <ul>
                <li>Persons with previous reactions to tetracyclines.</li>
                <li>Persons with severe liver and kidney diseases.</li>
                <li>Children below 12 years</li>
                <li>Patients with acute porphyrias</li>
                <li>Pregnant</li>
                <li>Lactating women.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>All excluded patients should be referred to a suitably qualified medical professional.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><u><strong>Antimicrobials</strong></u></p>

    <div>Microbial resistance is a public health matter of major importance and great care should be taken to ensure that their inclusion in a direction is absolutely necessary and will not jeopardise strategies to combat increasing resistance.
        <p> </p>

        <p><strong>2.5 Actions for patients who do not wish to receive care under this PGD</strong></p>

        <ul>
            <li>The patient should be advised of the risks of malaria in the region being visited and given advice on bite avoidance and the signs and symptoms of malaria infection.</li>
            <li>Document advice given.</li>
            <li>Document refusal in notes.</li>
            <li>Seek medical advice if necessary</li>
        </ul>

        <p> </p>

        <p><strong>2.6 Precautions</strong></p>

        <p>No antimalarial drug provides 100% protection even if used strictly according to the recommendations. Malaria drugs reduce the risk of infection with around 80% to 95% depending on destination and living conditions. Prevention of mosquito bites is therefore still important even if the patient takes the antimalarial drugs regularly. Travellers should be told about the importance of avoiding mosquito bites, the importance of taking prophylaxis regularly and the importance of an immediate visit to their doctor if they fall ill within one year and especially within three months.</p>

        <p>Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines, including doxycycline. Patients likely to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. However, the patient should be informed that this may be transient and mild.</p>

        <p>Use in patients with impaired hepatic function- Doxycycline should be administered with caution to patients with hepatic impairment or those receiving potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Abnormal hepatic function has been reported rarely and has been caused by both the oral and parenteral administration of tetracyclines, including doxycycline.</p>

        <p>Excretion of doxycycline by the kidney is about 40% every 72 hours in individuals with normal renal function. This percentage excretion may fall to a range as low as 1-5% every 72 hours in individuals with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance below 10ml/min). Studies have shown no significant difference in the serum half-life of doxycycline in individuals with normal and severely impaired renal function. Haemodialysis does not alter the serum half-life of doxycycline. The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea. Studies to date indicate that this anti-anabolic effect does not occur with the use of doxycycline in patients with impaired renal function.</p>

        <p> </p>

        <p><strong>2.7 Concurrent medication</strong></p>

        <p>Check the latest BNF for the most up to date information on drug interactions, below is a summary of the most established doxycycline-drug interactions.</p>

        <p>The patient should understand to inform the pharmacist via the Travel information form if they take other capsules also non-prescription drugs. The efficacy of doxycycline is reduced if taken together with drugs containing calcium, magnesia or iron. These are found in antacids (against ulcer) drugs against constipation, vitamins and food supplements. Allow at least 3 hours between use of any of the above drugs and the intake of doxycycline.</p>

        <p>Phenobarbital, carbamazepine, primidone and phenytoin may increase the metabolism of doxycycline (reduced half-life). An increase in the daily dosage of doxycycline should be considered, the patient should be referred to receive further advice. Doxycycline may increase the plasma concentration of Ciclosporin. Co-administration should only be undertaken with appropriate monitoring, the patient should be referred to receive further advice.</p>

        <p><strong>Combined Oral Contraceptives</strong></p>

        <p>Latest recommendations state that there no additional contraceptive precautions are required when combined oral contraceptives are used with antibacterials that do not induce liver enzymes (ie doxycycline), unless diarrhoea or vomiting do occur. These recommendations should be discussed with the woman, who should be advised that information in the patient information leaflets may differ.</p>

        <p><strong>4. Description of treatment available under this direction</strong></p>

        <p><strong>4.1 Doxycycline capsule</strong></p>

        <p>Each Doxycycline capsule for oral administration contains either doxycycline 50mg or 100mg.</p>

        <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Doxycycline is a Prescription-only Medicines (PoM). </strong></span></p>

        <p> </p>

        <p><strong>4.2 Dose, route and frequency</strong></p>

        <p>Prophylaxis of malaria:</p>

        <p>Prophylaxis should commence 24 or 48 hours prior to entering a malaria- endemic area and continue during the period of the stay. Prophylaxis should continue for 28 days after leaving the area.</p>

        <p><strong>Dosage in Adults</strong></p>

        <p>One 100mg Doxycycline or two 50mg Doxycycline capsules daily.</p>

        <p><strong>Dosage in children between the ages of 12 and 16</strong></p>

        <p>This is the same dose as with adults (see above).</p>

        <p>These dosages are correct as of December 2011 please check the BNF for more up to date information.</p>

        <p> </p>

        <p><strong>4.3 Duration of treatment available under this PGD</strong></p>

        <p>Doxycycline has been shown to be safe for use for up to 2 years. Therefore, under the terms of this PGD the maximum duration of treatment is 24 months.</p>

        <p> </p>

        <p><strong>4.4 Adverse effects</strong></p>

        <p>Nausea and stomach pain are the most frequent complaints. In rare case itching, rash and allergic reactions may be seen.</p>

        <p>Doxycycline increases the sensitivity to sunlight and may trigger a so-called photo-allergic dermatitis on areas of the skin exposed to sunlight or artificial sunlight. This reaction may be seen up to a week after the last capsule of doxycycline. The frequency of photo allergic reactions are probably around 1 per 300 users for the most serious to about 3% for mild reactions. Prescription of doxycycline should be followed by advise on protection against sunlight.</p>

        <p>See the BNF for more information.</p>

        <p><strong>Treatment of overdose</strong></p>

        <p>The patient should be referred for medical attention immediately.</p>

        <p> </p>

        <p><strong>4.5 Advice to patient</strong></p>

        <p>The patient should also be advised that it is important to take the capsules at the same time each day, to complete the full course and to take the capsule with a full glass of water whilst standing up.</p>

        <p>In the event of vomiting within 1 hour of dosing, a repeat dose should be taken and the course continued as before. The patient should obtain more doxycycline capsules to replace those that were vomited.</p>

        <p>The patient information leaflet contained in the medicine(s) should be made accessible to the patient/parent/guardian. Where this is unavailable, or unsuitable, sufficient information should be given to the patient/parent/guardian in a language that they can understand.</p>

        <p> </p>

        <p><strong>4.6 Follow up treatment</strong></p>

        <p>Advise patient if the patient develops a fever upon returning that they should consult their GP as this may be a possible indication of malaria.</p>

        <p> </p>

        <p><strong>5. Documentation </strong>
            <br />
            <strong>5.1 Authorisation of administration</strong></p>

        <p><span>In order to use this authorised PGD, permission must be granted from the CQC line manager or pharmacy superintendent, as appropriate. Authorisation to </span><span>supply the medicine specified in this PGD is exclusively awarded by the authorising clinicians, upon completion of bespoke training and assessment set out by </span>https://hubnet.io<span>. </span></p>

        <p> </p>

        <p><strong>5.2 Record of supply </strong>
            <br /> An electronic or paper record for recording the screening of patients prior to and subsequent to the supply of medicine under this PGD must be completed in order to allow audit of practice. This should include:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Name and address of the patient</li>
            <li>Date of birth</li>
            <li>Consultant/General practitioner details</li>
            <li>Exclusion criteria, record why treatment was not supplied in the RAF notes section.</li>
            <li>The name of the medicine supplied including brand and quantity.</li>
            <li>Signature and name in capital letters of the practitioner who supplied treatment</li>
            <li>Date the medicine was given</li>
            <li>Record of adverse effects</li>
            <li>Signature of legal guardian accompanying the child</li>
        </ol>

        <p>A record of the supply must be made. This can either be done electronically on https://hubnet.io or into the patient’s case notes.</p>

        <p>For young people, these records should be retained until the patient's 25th birthday or 8 years whichever is the longer time period.</p>

        <p>For 17 years and over, retain for 8 years after the conclusion of treatment, or for 3 years after death, or in accordance with local policy, where this is greater than above. If a physical tRAF/mRAF is used, this must be retained on the CQC or GPhC registered premises.</p>

        <p> </p>

        <p><strong>5.3 Consent </strong></p>

        <p>Prior to the supply of a medicine, consent must be obtained, preferably written, from the patient, and documented either in the patient’s medical records/notes or on an administration form.</p>

        <p>The key points include: -</p>

        <ul>
            <li>If a patient’s fitness and suitability cannot be established, supply should be deferred.</li>
            <li>There is no legal requirement for consent to be in writing but written consent serves to record the decision and the discussions that have taken place.</li>
            <li>Consent - either written or verbal - is required at the time of each supply.</li>
            <li>Consent remains valid unless the individual who gave it withdraws it. If there is new information between the time consent was given and when the supply is offered, including new evidence of risk, new medicines becoming available or where there is a significant change in the individual’s condition, it may be necessary for the patient to reconfirm their consent.</li>
            <li>Written and verbal information should be available in a form that can be easily understood by the person who will be giving the consent. Where English is not easily understood, translations and properly recognised interpreters should be used in order that they can make informed consent.</li>
            <li>The bringing of a patient for the supply after an invitation to attend for this purpose may be viewed as acceptance that the patient may have the administration.</li>
            <li>Individuals (patient, parent, guardian or person with parental responsibility) should also be informed about how data on the supply will be stored, who will be able to access that information and how that data may be used.</li>
            <li>Where consent is either refused or withdrawn, this decision must be documented.</li>
            <li>Consent obtained before the occasion upon which a patient is brought for the supply is only an agreement for the patient to be included in the administration programme and does not mean that consent is in place for each future administration.</li>
        </ul>

        <p> </p>

        <p><strong>5.4 Audit </strong>
            <br /> All health risk assessment, advice, medicine supply record and record of emergency management of anaphylaxis should be stored in the pharmacy or CQC registered business and will be audited by a line manager designated healthcare professional every year, in order to analyse service delivery. Upon reviewing the audit, if the service is deemed insufficient by the line auditor, Voyager Medical must be immediately notified and the CQC manager or superintendent pharmacist must informed. An action plan to remedy the insufficiencies will then be required to submit to the Voyager Medical medical team for analysis.</p>
