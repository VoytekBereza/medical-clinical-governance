    <p><strong>1. Introduction</strong>
        <br /> Any extension to professional roles with regard to the supply of medicines must take into account the need to protect patient safety, ensure continuity of care and safeguard patient choice and convenience. It also has to be cost-effective and bring demonstrable benefits to patient care.</p>

    <p>This patient group direction (PGD) will increase patient care in the area of travel medicine as there will be a specialised travel medicine professional handling all consultations. This PGD has been created with the aim of providing an efficient and effective Travel Health Service to Patients.</p>

    <p>This PGD is designed to guide pharmacists on the supply of Atovaquone & Proguanil Hydrochloride to patients requiring malaria prophylaxis for travel purposes. Atovaquone & Proguanil Hydrochloride are fixed dose combinations of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride which act as blood schizonticides and also have activity against hepatic schizonts of <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em>.</p>

    <p>Four steps remain essential to prevent damage to health due to malaria in UK travellers:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>A</strong>wareness: know about the risk of malaria.</li>
        <li><strong>B</strong>ites by mosquitoes: prevent or avoid.</li>
        <li><strong>C</strong>ompliance with appropriate <strong>C</strong>hemoprophylaxis.</li>
        <li><strong>D</strong>iagnose breakthrough malaria swiftly and obtain treatment promptly.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Recent guidelines give greater emphasis to the importance of balancing the risk of malaria and the risk of adverse reactions to antimalarials.</p>

    <p>PGDs do not remove inherent professional obligations or accountability. It is the responsibility of each professional to practice only within the bounds of their own competence.</p>

    <p class="p1"><span class="s1">This PGD relates to two counterpart documents entitled:</span></p>

    <ul class="ul1">
        <li class="li2"><span class="s1">"Travel Risk Assessment Form" termed "tRAF" throughout the </span>https://hubnet.io/ <span class="s1"> website.</span></li>
        <li class="li2"><span class="s1">“Malaria Risk Assessment Form" termed “mRAF" throughout the </span>https://hubnet.io/ <span class="s1"> website.</span></li>
    </ul>

    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This PGD will be reviewed annually, by the authorising clinicians, to ensure that it reflects contemporary guidance.</strong></span></p>

    <p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>2. Clinical Decision Making</strong>
        <br />
        <strong>2.1 Inclusion Criteria</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>Travellers going to malaria-endemic areas of the world where there is chloroquine or mefloquine resistant falciparum malaria, who are at moderate to high risk of exposure.</li>
        <li>Atovaquone with proguanil combinations are also used as an alternative to mefloquine or doxycycline.</li>
        <li><strong>Completion of the tRAF/mRAF in conjunction with the tRAF<strong>/mRAF</strong> guidance for PGD authorised clinicians provided on www.hubnet.io.</strong>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p> </p>

    <p><strong>2.2 Patients who may receive the supply of Atovaquone & Proguanil Hydrochloride</strong>
        <br /> All patients in 2.1 above, who do not want specifically to consult with a doctor and are willing to have treatment from the PGD authorised healthcare professional.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p><strong>2.3 Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>Atovaquone 250mg & Proguanil Hydrochloride 100mg full strength tablets are not recommended for malaria prophylaxis in persons <strong>under 40 kg bodyweight</strong>. (Approximate weight of 12-year-old is 39 Kg) for this Atovaquone 62.5mg & Proguanil Hydrochloride 25mg must be used.</li>
        <li>Atovaquone 62.5mg & Proguanil Hydrochloride 25mg, should not be used in patients <strong>weighing less than 11Kg</strong>.</li>
        <li>Atovaquone & Proguanil Hydrochloride is contraindicated in individuals with known <strong>hypersensitivity</strong> to atovaquone or proguanil hydrochloride or any component of the formulation. See SPC for details.</li>
        <li>Atovaquone & Proguanil Hydrochloride is contraindicated for prophylaxis of P. falciparum malaria in patients with <strong>renal impairment</strong> (creatinine clearance
            < 30mL/min).</li>
                <li>Women who are <strong>pregnant</strong> or <strong>breast feeding</strong>, should not receive Atovaquone & Proguanil Hydrochloride.</li>
                <li>The patient is between the ages of 16-18 and not accompanied by a legal guardian unless the pharmacist has undergone a successful Enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS - previously called an enhanced CRB check)</li>
                <li>The patient is under the age of 16 and does not have an accompanying guardian who is legally authorised to consent on the child's behalf.</li>
                <li><strong>Absence of valid consent.</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p> </p>

    <p><strong>2.4 Actions to be taken regarding care of excluded patients</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>Reschedule or refer to General Practitioner as clinically indicated.</li>
        <li>Discuss with patient/ parent/ guardian and document the reasons for exclusion from treatment under the PGD.</li>
    </ul>

    <p> </p>

    <p><strong>2.5 Actions for patients who do not wish to receive care under this PGD</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>The patient should be advised of the risks of malaria in the region being visited and given advice on bite avoidance and the signs and symptoms of malaria infection.</li>
        <li>Document advice given.</li>
        <li>Document refusal in notes.</li>
        <li>Seek medical advice if necessary</li>
    </ul>

    <p> </p>

    <p><strong>2.6 Precautions</strong></p>

    <p>The safety and effectiveness of Atovaquone 62.5mg & Proguanil Hydrochloride 25mg for prophylaxis of malaria in children who weigh less than 11 kg has not been established.</p>

    <p>Persons taking Atovaquone & Proguanil Hydrochloride for prophylaxis of malaria should take a repeat dose if they vomit within 1 hour of dosing. In the event of diarrhoea, normal dosing should be continued. Absorption of atovaquone may be reduced in patients with diarrhoea or vomiting, but diarrhoea or vomiting is not associated with reduced efficacy. However, as with other antimalarial agents, subjects with diarrhoea or vomiting should be advised to continue to comply with personal protection measures (repellants, bednets).</p>

    <p>No antimalarial drug provides 100% protection even if used strictly according to the recommendations. Malaria drugs reduce the risk of infection with around 80% to 95% depending on your destination and living conditions. Travellers should be told about the importance of avoiding mosquito bites, the importance of taking prophylaxis regularly and the importance of an immediate visit to their doctor if they fall ill within one year and especially within three months.</p>

    <p>Occasionally, severe allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis) have been reported in patients taking Atovaquone & Proguanil Hydrochloride. If patients experience an allergic reaction, Atovaquone & Proguanil Hydrochloride should be discontinued promptly and appropriate treatment initiated.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p><strong>2.7 Concurrent medication</strong></p>

    <p>Check the latest BNF for the most up to date information on drug interactions, below is a summary of the most established Atovaquone & Proguanil Hydrochloride interactions.</p>

    <p>Proguanil may potentiate the anticoagulant effect of warfarin and other coumarin based anticoagulants. Caution is advised when initiating or withdrawing malaria prophylaxis in patients on continuous treatment with coumarin based anticoagulants.</p>

    <p>Concomitant treatment with metoclopramide and tetracycline have been associated with a significant decrease in plasma concentration of atovaquone.</p>

    <p>Concomitant administration of atovaquone and indinavir results in a decrease in the Cmin of indinavir (23% decrease; 90% CI 8-35%). Caution should be exercised when prescribing atovaquone with indinavir due to the decrease in the trough levels of indinavir.</p>

    <p>Concomitant administration of rifampicin or rifabutin is known to reduce atovaquone levels by approximately 50% and 34%, respectively and is not recommended.</p>

    <p>Atovaquone is highly protein bound (> 99%) but does not displace other highly protein bound drugs in vitro, indicating significant drug interactions arising from displacement are unlikely.</p>

    <p><strong>5. Documentation </strong>
        <br />
        <strong>5.1 Authorisation of administration </strong></p>

    <p><span>In order to use this authorised PGD, permission must be granted from the CQC line manager or pharmacy superintendent, as appropriate. Authorisation to supply the medicine specified in this PGD is exclusively awarded by the authorising clinicians, upon completion of bespoke training and assessment set </span>on https://hubnet.io.?<span> </span></p>

    <p> </p>

    <p><strong>5.2 Record of supply </strong>
        <br /> An electronic or paper record for recording the screening of patients prior to and subsequent to the supply of medicine under this PGD must be completed in order to allow audit of practice. This should include:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Name and address of the patient.</li>
        <li>Date of birth.</li>
        <li>Consultant/General practitioner details.</li>
        <li>Exclusion criteria, record why treatment was not supplied in the RAF notes section.</li>

        <li>Date medicine given.</li>
        <li>Record of adverse effects.</li>
        <li>Signature of legal guardian accompanying the child.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>A record of the supply must be made. This can either be done electronically on hubnet.io or into the patient’s case notes.</p>

    <p>For young people, these records should be retained until the patient's 25th birthday or 8 years whichever is the longer time period.</p>

    <p>For 17 years and over, retain for 8 years after the conclusion of treatment, or for 3 years after death, or in accordance with local policy, where this is greater than above. If a physical tRAF/mRAF is used, this must be retained on the CQC or GPhC registered premises.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p><strong>5.3 Consent </strong></p>

    <p>Prior to the supply of a medicine, consent must be obtained, preferably written, from the patient, and documented either in the patient’s medical records/notes or on an administration form.</p>

    <p>The key points include: -</p>

    <ul>
        <li>If a patient’s fitness and suitability cannot be established, supply should be deferred.</li>
        <li>There is no legal requirement for consent to be in writing but written consent serves to record the decision and the discussions that have taken place.</li>
        <li>Consent - either written or verbal - is required at the time of each supply.</li>
        <li>Consent remains valid unless the individual who gave it withdraws it. If there is new information between the time consent was given and when the supply is offered, including new evidence of risk, new medicines becoming available or where there is a significant change in the individual’s condition, it may be necessary for the patient to reconfirm their consent.</li>
        <li>Written and verbal information should be available in a form that can be easily understood by the person who will be giving the consent. Where English is not easily understood, translations and properly recognised interpreters should be used in order that they can make informed consent.</li>
        <li>The bringing of a patient for the supply after an invitation to attend for this purpose may be viewed as acceptance that the patient may have the administration.</li>
        <li>Individuals (patient, parent, guardian or person with parental responsibility) should also be informed about how data on the supply will be stored, who will be able to access that information and how that data may be used.</li>
        <li>Where consent is either refused or withdrawn, this decision must be documented.</li>
        <li>Consent obtained before the occasion upon which a patient is brought for the supply is only an agreement for the patient to be included in the administration programme and does not mean that consent is in place for each future administration.</li>
    </ul>

    <p> </p>

    <p><strong>5.4 Audit </strong>
        <br /> All health risk assessment, advice, medicine supply record and record of emergency management of anaphylaxis should be stored in the pharmacy or CQC registered business and will be audited by a line manager designated healthcare professional every year, in order to analyse service delivery. Upon reviewing the audit, if the service is deemed insufficient by the line auditor, Voyager Medical must be immediately notified and the CQC manager or superintendent pharmacist must be informed. An action plan to remedy the insufficiencies will then be required to submit to the Voyager Medical medical team for analysis.</p>
