    <p><strong>1. Introduction</strong>
        <br /> This document is a comprises three PGDs for sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, which is the inability to achieve or maintain a penile erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. These PGDs have been combined as these PDE-5 inhibitors share similar pharmacological action, differences have been extensively highlighted throughout this document.</p>

    <p>This patient group direction (PGD) is designed to guide healthcare professionals on the supply of sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil for erectile dysfunction. The purpose of this PGD is to enable a healthcare professional, working within a CQC registered business or GPhC registered pharmacy, who has received specific training and has been assessed as competent to administer medicines in accordance with the following PGD and recommendations issued by the Department of Health.</p>

    <p>It is the responsibility of individual healthcare professionals and their line manager to ensure that they work within the terms laid down in this PGD and to ensure that staff are working to the most up to date PGD. By doing so, the quality of the services offered will be maintained, and the chances of staff making erroneous decisions which may affect patient, staff or visitor safety and comfort will be reduced. Supervisory staff at all levels must ensure that staff using this PGD act within their own level of competence. PGDs do not remove inherent professional obligations or accountability. It is the responsibility of each professional to practice only within the bounds of their own competence.</p>

    <p>This PGD relates to a counterpart document entitled “Erectile Dysfunction Risk Assessment Form" termed “edRAF" throughout the https://hubnet.io website.</p>

    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This PGD will be reviewed annually, by the authorising clinicians, to ensure that it reflects contemporary guidance.</strong></span>
        <br />

    <p> </p>

    <p><strong>2.5 Precautions</strong></p>

    <p>Caution should be taken if the patient is suffering from cardiovascular disease. If the patient suffers from any of the following side effects they should be referred to a doctor as soon as possible:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Loss of vision or hearing</li>
        <li>Chest pain with nausea and discomfort</li>
        <li>Continuous painful erection lasting 4 or more hours</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Before supplying erectile dysfunction medicines to patients who are eligible to receive them on the NHS, the pharmacist should ensure that the patient is aware of this fact. Conditions which may make the patient eligible include: multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, polio, prostate cancer, severe pelvic or spinal injury, spina bifida certain genetic conditions, such as Huntington's disease. Patients can also get ED medication on the NHS if they have had any of the following treatments: pelvic surgery, surgical removal of the prostate gland (prostatectomy), dialysis for kidney failure and kidney transplant.</p>

    <p><strong>N.B. Dizziness and altered vision were reported in clinical trials with sildenafil, patients should be aware of how they may react before driving or operating machinery.</strong></p>

    <p> </p>

    <p><strong>2.6 Concurrent medication</strong></p>

    <p>Drug-drug interactions with PDE-5 inhibitors have not been explored in detail. However, some known interactions do exist. Below is a brief summary of these, however, for the latest information all pharmacists authorised under this PGD should consult the most current BNF.</p>

    <p>Use of other co-cominant treatments for erectile dysfunction medicines (eg. alprostadil) contraindicates patients for treatment under this PGD. PDE-5 inhibitors are contraindicated in patients receiving the following medicines:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Medicinal nitrates</strong> (including oral, transdermal and sublingual)</li>
        <li><strong>Recreational nitrates</strong> such as amyl nitrate (poppers)</li>
        <li><strong>Alpha-Blockers</strong> (unless stabilised for more than 2 months)</li>
        <li><strong>Anti-virals</strong> - mainly protease inhibitors. Atazanavir, etravirine, fosamprenavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir.</li>
        <li><strong>Nicorandil </strong></li>
        <li>Combination of <strong>tadalafil</strong> and <strong>doxazosin</strong>.</li>
        <li>Combinations of <strong>vardenafil</strong> and treatments for <strong>arrhythmias</strong>, (eg quinidine, procainamide...)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Alpha Blockers</strong></span>: If the patient has been stabilised on an alpha blocker for more than 2 months there is a slight increase in the risk of hypotension. This may prove clinically useful however if this arises it is best to take half of the initial dose.</p>

    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Imidazole antifungals</strong></span>: Ketoconazole, imidazole. Half the initial dose and then titrate up accordingly.</p>

    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Macrolide antibiotics</strong></span>: Clarithromycin, erythromycin, telithromycin. Half the initial dose and then titrate up accordingly.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p><strong>4.2 Dose, route and frequency</strong></p>

    <p>All erectile dysfunction medicine presented in this PGD are exclusively for oral administration and should be taken about 60 minutes before their action is needed. Swallow tablets whole with water. Taking ED medication with food can delay the onset of action to 2 hours.</p>

    <p>Combinations of sildenafil citrate, vardenafil and tadalafil should not be taken in combination without a break of 36 hours between one medication and another.</p>

    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sildenafil </strong></span></p>

    <p>Adults (over 18 years of age) initially 50mg approximately 1 hour before sexual activity, subsequent doses should be adjusted according to the response to 25-100mg as a single dose as needed a maximum of one dose in 24 hours (max.single dose 100mg). Suggested pharmacy label wording:"One tablet approximately one hour before sexual activity. Maximum of one tablet in 24 hours."</p>

    <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vardenafil </span></strong></p>

    <p>Adults (over 18 years of age) initially 10mg approximately 25-60 minutes before sexual intercourse (vardenafil has been shown to act quicker than other erectile dysfunction medicines), subsequent doses adjusted according to initial response up to a maximum of 20mg as a single dose. Maximum one dose in 24 hours. Suggested pharmacy label wording:"One tablet approximately 25-60 minutes before sexual activity. Maximum of one tablet in 24 hours."</p>

    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Tadalafil </strong></span></p>

    <p>Adults (over 18 years of age) initially 10mg approximately 30 minutes before sexual activity, subsequent doses adjusted according to response, up to 20mg as a single dose. Maximum 1 dose in 24 hours (but daily dose of 10-20mg not recommended). Suggested pharmacy label wording:"One tablet approximately 30 minutes before sexual activity. Maximum of one tablet in 48 hours."</p>

    <p>Men who need regular ED medication twice or more a week have the option to take low dose tadalafil either 2.5mg or 5mg tablets once daily on a continuous basis. The daily dose is low; however, tadalafil stays in the body for 36 hours and builds up to effective levels when taken daily. The dose instruction for low dose daily tadalafil 2.5mg or 5mg is for one tablet to be taken daily around the same time each day.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p><strong>4.5 Choice of either sildenafil, vardenafil or tadalafil </strong></p>

    <p>Initiation of ED treatment usually starts with supply of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>sildenafil</strong></span> as it has the longest history of clinical data. In the event that the patient requests another medicine the patients motivation and contraindications should be discussed. Sildenafil has the shortest half-life (4 hours) in comparison to tadalafil (36 hours) and vardenafil (12 hours). <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Vardenafil</strong></span> is the fastest acting and the effect should be present within 30 minutes of taking the tablet. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Tadalafil</strong></span> is most suited to patients who expect to continue sexual activity for a prolonged period.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p><strong>4.6 Duration of treatment available under this PGD </strong></p>

    <p>In respects to frequency of the use of erectile dysfunction medicines, it is unusual in that there appears to be no clinical reason to restrict the number of tablets (up to one a day) prescribed to an individual in any given period, however, quantity is restricted on this PGD. Quantity of tablets and repeats:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sildenafil / Vardenafil</strong>: Supply 4 or 8 tablets. Repeat no more frequently than at 1 or 2 week intervals respectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Tadalafil</strong>: Supply 4 or 8 tablets. Repeat no more frequently than at 2 or 4 week intervals respectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Tadalafil (2.5mg/5mg)</strong>: Patients taking regular daily Cialis must inform their GPs, particularly where existing or new medication is being prescribed. Can be repeated for continuous daily use. Supply 28 tablets initially. Repeat no more frequently than at 1 or 2 month intervals.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In general, it is good to note that the average frequency of sexual intercourse in the 40 - 60 age range is once a week.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p><strong>4.7 Adverse effects </strong></p>

    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sildenafil </strong></span></p>

    <p>The most common side effects of sildenafil include dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, headache (including migraine) flushing, dizziness, myalgia, back pain, visual disturbances (non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy has been reported - stop drug if sudden visual impairment occurs) and nasal congestion.</p>

    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Vardenafil </strong></span></p>

    <p>The most common side effects include: dizziness; flushing; headache; heartburn; nausea; stuffy or runny nose; upset stomach. At the 20 mg dose Levitra film-coated tablets, elderly ( 65 years old) patients had higher frequencies of headaches (16.2% versus 11.8%) and dizziness (3.7% versus 0.7%) than younger patients (
        < 65 years old). In general, the incidence of adverse reactions (especially “dizziness”) has been shown to be slightly higher in patients with a history of hypertension.</p>

            <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Tadalafil</strong></span></p>

            <p>The most common side effects include: cough; dizziness; flushing; headache; heartburn; mild back or muscle pain; stomach upset; stuffy or runny nose. See the most current BNF for more information. Treatment of overdose Patient should be referred for medical attention immediately.</p>

            <p> </p>

            <p><strong>4.8 Advice to patient </strong></p>

            <p>Experience to date suggests sildenafil can safely be prescribed throughout life provided that this is within the terms of the summary of product characteristics in the marketing authorisation (which specifies contraindications and a starting age of 18). However, the frequency of contra-indications increases with age, and SMAC is particularly concerned that prolonged prescribing could mask the progression of serious underlying disease. Some psychological causes of erectile dysfunction resolve spontaneously or with treatment, so the need for and tolerance of sildenafil should be reassessed at 1-3 months. Thereafter the appropriateness of prescribing should normally be checked yearly, but stopped immediately if interacting drugs have to be prescribed for other conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>5. Documentation </strong>
                <br />
                <strong>5.1 Authorisation of administration </strong>
                <br /> In order to use this authorised PGD, permission must be granted from the CQC line manager or pharmacy superintendent, as appropriate. Authorisation to supply erectile dysfunction medicines under this PGD is exclusively awarded by the authorising clinicians, upon completion of bespoke training and assessment set out by Voyager Medical. </p>

            <p> </p>

            <p><strong>5.2 Record of supply </strong>
                <br /> An electronic or paper record for recording the screening of patients prior to and subsequent to the supply of medicine under this PGD must be completed in order to allow audit of practice. This should include:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Name and address of the patient.</li>
                <li>Date of birth.</li>
                <li>Consultant/General practitioner details.</li>
                <li>Exclusion criteria, record why treatment was not supplied in the RAF notes section.</li>
                <li>The name of the medicine supplied including brand and quantity.</li>
                <li>Signature and name in capital letters of the practitioner who supplied treatment.</li>
                <li>Date the medicine was given.</li>
                <li>Record of adverse effects.</li>
                <li>Signature of the patient receiving treatment.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>A record of the supply must be made. This can either be done electronically on https://hubnet.io or into the patient’s case notes.</p>

            <p>For patients aged 18 years and over, retain for 8 years after the conclusion of treatment, or for 3 years after death, or in accordance with local policy, where this is greater than above. If a physical edRAF is used, this must be retained on the CQC or GPhC registered premises.</p>

            <p> </p>

            <p><strong>5.3 Consent </strong></p>

            <p>Prior to the supply of a medicine, consent must be obtained, preferably written, from the patient, and documented either in the patient’s medical records/notes or on an administration form.</p>

            <p>The key points about consent include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>If a patient’s fitness and suitability cannot be established, supply should be deferred.</li>
                <li>There is no legal requirement for consent to be in writing but written consent serves to record the decision and the discussions that have taken place and that the patient or person with parental responsibility giving consent on a child’s behalf has been informed about the process, benefits and risks of supply.</li>
                <li>Consent - either written or verbal - is required at the time of each supply.</li>
                <li>Consent remains valid unless the individual who gave it withdraws it. If there is new information between the time consent was given and when the supply is offered, including new evidence of risk, new medicines becoming available or where there is a significant change in the individual’s condition, it may be necessary for the patient to reconfirm their consent.</li>
                <li>Written and verbal information should be available in a form that can be easily understood by the person who will be giving the consent. Where English is not easily understood, translations and properly recognised interpreters should be used in order that they can make informed consent.</li>
                <li>The bringing of a patient for the supply after an invitation to attend for this purpose may be viewed as acceptance that the patient may have the administration.</li>
                <li>Individuals (patient, parent, guardian or person with parental responsibility) should also be informed about how data on the supply will be stored, who will be able to access that information and how that data may be used.</li>
                <li>Where consent is either refused or withdrawn, this decision must be documented.</li>
                <li>Consent obtained before the occasion upon which a patient is brought for the supply is only an agreement for the patient to be included in the administration programme and does not mean that consent is in place for each future administration.</li>
            </ul>

            <p> </p>

            <p><strong>5.4 Audit </strong>
                <br /> All health risk assessment, advice, medicine supply record and record of emergency management of anaphylaxis should be stored in the pharmacy or CQC registered business and will be audited by a line manager designated healthcare professional every year, in order to analyse service delivery. Upon reviewing the audit, if the service is deemed insufficient by the line auditor, Voyager Medical must be immediately notified and the CQC manager or superintendent pharmacist must be informed. An action plan to remedy the insufficiencies will then be required to submit to the Voyager Medical medical team for analysis.</p>
