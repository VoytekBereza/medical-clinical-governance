<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong><br /><span>This patient group direction (PGD)&nbsp;is designed to guide healthcare professionals on the supply and subsequent administration of Varicella&nbsp;vaccines. The purpose of this PGD is to enable a healthcare professional, working within a CQC registered business or GPhC registered pharmacy, who has received specific training and has been assessed as competent to administer medicines in accordance with the following PGD and recommendations issued by the Department of Health. </span><br /><br /><span>It is the responsibility of individual healthcare professionals and their line manager to ensure that they work within the terms laid down in this PGD and to ensure that staff are working to the most up to date PGD. By doing so, the quality of the services offered will be maintained, and the chances of staff making erroneous decisions which may affect patient, staff or visitor safety and comfort will be reduced. Supervisory staff at all levels must ensure that staff using this PGD act within their own level of competence. PGDs do not remove inherent professional obligations or accountability. It is the responsibility of each professional to practice only within the bounds of their own competence.</span></p>
<p>This PGD relates to a counterpart document entitled &ldquo;Travel Management Risk Assessment Form" termed &ldquo;tRAF" throughout the Voyager Medical website.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This PGD will be reviewed annually, by the authorising clinicians, to ensure that it reflects contemporary guidance.</strong></span></p>
<p><br /> <strong>2. Clinical decision making</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.1 Inclusion criteria</strong><br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Pre exposure vaccination</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Sero &ndash;negative health care workers at risk of developing chicken pox (Varicella Zoster virus).</li>
<li>Laboratory staff that may be exposed to varicella virus in the course of their work.</li>
<li>Contacts of immunocompromised patients e.g. siblings of a child with leukaemia.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Post exposure prophylaxis</strong></span></p>
<p>Unvaccinated healthcare workers without a definite history of chicken pox or zoster and having a significant exposure to Varicella Zoster Virus. See Green Book.</p>
<p><strong><strong><strong></strong></strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong><strong>2.2 Patients who may receive the administration of Varicella&nbsp;vaccine</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></strong></p>
<p><span>All patients in 2.1 above, who do not want specifically to consult with a doctor and are willing to have treatment from the PGD authorised health professional.</span></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>2.3 Exclusion criteria </strong> <br /> Patients may receive the administration of Varicella&nbsp;vaccines under this PGD unless:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aged <strong>under 1 year of age</strong>.</li>
<li>Confirmed <strong>anaphylactic</strong> or <strong>hypersensitivity</strong> reaction to any component or a preceding dose of Varicella vaccine.</li>
<li>Check the manufacturers&rsquo; information prior to administration of any vaccine/immunoglobulin re its latex content. If latex is a component of the vaccine/immunoglobulin or the administration system (e.g. vial or syringe etc.) then a latex-free alternative must be offered to patients with latex sensitivity.</li>
<li><strong>Pregnancy</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Immunosuppressed</strong> patients.</li>
<li>Family history of <strong>congenital</strong>/<strong>hereditary</strong> <strong>immunodeficiency</strong> unless immune competency of the individual is demonstrated.</li>
<li>Patients under <strong>16 years of age who are receiving aspirin</strong> or other <strong>salicylate </strong>containing medication under medical supervision due to theoretical risk of <strong>Reye&rsquo;s syndrome</strong>.</li>
<li>Immunisation must be postponed in those patients with acute <strong>febrile</strong> <strong>illness</strong>.</li>
<li>Patients who have received <strong>immunoglobulin</strong> or <strong>blood transfusion</strong> in the last 3 months (5 months for Varivax&reg;) - delay vaccination because of the likelihood of vaccine failure due to passively acquired antibody to the varicella virus.</li>
<li>Active untreated <strong>tuberculosis</strong> (Varivax&reg; only).</li>
<li>Blood <strong>dyscrasias</strong>, <strong>leukaemia</strong>, <strong>lymphomas</strong> (Varivax&reg; only).</li>
<li>Any patient treated with Varicella-Zoster Immunoglobulin within the preceding <strong>3 months</strong>.</li>
<li>Any patient treated with a live vaccine within the preceding <strong>4 weeks</strong>.</li>
<li><b>Absence of valid consent.</b></li>
</ul>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>2.4 Precautions</strong></p>
<p>(i) If the patient is unwell, pyrexial, off food, has diarrhoea or vomiting, is lethargic or there is a suspicion of an infectious illness, immunisation should be deferred.<br /> (ii) As with any intramuscular (IM) vaccination, the injection should be given with caution to individuals with a bleeding disorder. Green Book recommendation is to vaccinate by deep subcutaneous (SC) injection.<br /> (iii) Varicella&nbsp;vaccine should never be administered intravenously.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>2.5 Action to be taken when a patient is excluded from treatment under this PGD</strong><br /> If a patient is excluded from treatment under this PGD, medical advice should be sought &ndash; refer to a doctor.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>2.6 Action to be taken when a patient does not wish to receive treatment under this PGD</strong><br /> The patient should be advised of the risks of not receiving the vaccination. In turn if the patient still does not want treatment their reasons should be written in their notes. The patient should not be compelled to be administered the vaccine.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>2.7 Concurrent medication </strong> <br />Varicella&nbsp;vaccines may be given at the same time as other vaccines. When concomitant administration is considered necessary, the vaccines must be given at different injection sites, preferably in a different limb. If given in the same limb, they should be at least 2.5cm apart.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>

<p></p>
<p><b>3.1 Training requirements</b></p>
<p>Before this document may be utilised in practice, the healthcare professional must satisfy the bespoke training and assessment requirements set out by http://voyagermedical.com.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All healthcare professionals who have undergone all elements of training in both theoretical and practical aspects relating to this PGD should have a certificate of competence signed by an authorising trainer. A copy of which should be held in the individual healthcare professionals records.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>3.2 Requirements for Continuing Professional Development (CPD)</b></p>
<p>All staff which participate in the implementation of this PGD should participate in adequate CPD to ensure practices follow the most up to date clinical developments.</p>
<p>Regular updates in immunisation and vaccination, anaphylaxis and basic life support every 12 months or sooner if deemed necessary by the authorising parties of this document or the implementing organisations line manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Description of treatment available under this direction <br /> 4.1&nbsp;Varicella vaccines</strong></p>
<p>Varicella-zoster vaccine:Varilrix &reg; or Varivax&reg;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Varicella&nbsp;vaccines&nbsp;are Prescription-only Medicines (PoMs).</strong></span></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>4.2 Form / Dose: </strong><br />Varilrix&reg; 0.5ml - deep subcutaneous injection in the deltoid region or anterolateral thigh.</p>
<p>Varivax&reg;&nbsp;<span>0.5ml&nbsp;</span>- given by injection either intramuscularly (IM) or deep subcutaneously (SC) Prepare as per manufacturers&rsquo; instructions</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>4.3 Storage <br /> </strong>+2 and +8 &ordm; C (in a refrigerator). Do not freeze &ndash; Discard if vaccine has been frozen. Freezing destroys the potency of the vaccine. Keep in original pack to protect from light.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>4.4 Frequency<br /> </strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Pre - exposure vaccine </strong></span></p>
<p>All individuals aged one year and older should receive two doses of varicella vaccine, 4-8 weeks apart.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Post &ndash;exposure prophylaxis </strong></span></p>
<p>Varivax&reg;-(Dosage as above) may be given up to 5 days post-exposure.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>4.5 Management of care and adverse reactions </strong></p>
<p>Most common side effects are pain, redness and swelling at injection site. Other reactions may include-tiredness, raised temperature, headache, rash. Severe reactions are rare. This list is not exhaustive. Refer to BNF and SPC for complete list. If noted, complete &amp; submit a Yellow Card via www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard For ▼ drugs - Report all suspected adverse drug reactions For up to date SPCs and PILs www.medicines.org.uk/emc</p>
<p><strong>Medical advice in cases of anaphylaxis</strong><br /> Vaccine recipients should remain under observation until they have been seen to recover from the procedure. The onset set of anaphylaxis is rapid, typically within minutes, and its clinical course is unpredictable with variable severity and clinical features. Due to the unpredictable nature of anaphylactic reactions it is not possible to define a particular time period over which all individuals should be observed following immunisation to ensure they do not develop anaphylaxis.</p>
<p>Pharmacists should confirm with patients that they are fit to leave the premises. Patients should not leave if they are feeling at all unwell without speaking to the pharmacist first. If necessary, a doctor or the patient&rsquo;s GP should be contacted for advice.</p>
<p>If anaphylaxis is suspected and emergency ambulance must be called on 999 or seek urgent medical advice. (Refer to PGD for the administration of adrenaline/epinephrine in cases of suspected hypersensitivity and/or anaphylactic reactions).</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>4.6 Advice</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that the patient information leaflet is available &amp; offered to every patient/parent/guardian.</li>
<li>Advice on the prevention and management of fever and local reactions and other adverse effects.</li>
<li>Avoid use of salicylates for 6 weeks after vaccination.</li>
<li>The patient should avoid pregnancy between the 2 doses and for 3 months after the second dose. May also need to undergo pregnancy testing prior to vaccination.</li>
<li>Common post-vaccination adverse effects.</li>
<li>Date of next vaccination as required.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>5. Documentation <br /> </strong><strong>5.1 Authorisation of administration </strong><br />In order to use this authorised PGD, permission must be granted from the CQC line manager or pharmacy superintendent, as appropriate. Authorisation to administer varicella&nbsp;vaccines under this PGD is exclusively awarded by the authorising clinicians, upon completion of bespoke training and assessment set out by Voyager Medical.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>5.2 Record of supply </strong> <br /> An electronic or paper record for recording the screening of patients prior to and subsequent to the supply of medicine under this PGD must be completed in order to allow audit of practice. This should include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Name and address of patient</li>
<li>Date of birth</li>
<li>Consultant/General practitioner details</li>
<li>Exclusion criteria, record why treatment was not supplied in the RAF notes section.</li>
<li>The name of the medicine supplied including brand and quantity.</li>
<li>Signature and name in capital letters of practitioner who supplied treatment</li>
<li>Date medicine given</li>
<li>Anatomical site of vaccine administration</li>
<li>Record of adverse effects</li>
<li>Signature of legal guardian accompanying the child</li>
</ol>
<p>A record of the supply must be made. This can either be done electronically on VoyagerMedical.com or into the patient&rsquo;s case notes.</p>
<p>For young people, these records should be retained until the patient's 25th birthday or 8 years whichever is the longer time period.</p>
<p>For 17 years and over, retain for 8 years after conclusion of treatment, or for 3 years after death, or in accordance with local policy, where this is greater than above. If a physical tRAF is used, this must be retained on the CQC or GPhC registered premises.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>5.3 Consent </strong> <br /> Prior to the administration and/or supply of a medicine, consent must be obtained, preferably written, from the patient, and documented either in the patient&rsquo;s medical records/notes or on an administration form.</p>
<p>Prior to the administration of a vaccine, consent must be obtained, preferably written, either from the patient, parent, guardian or person with parental responsibility and documented either in the patient&rsquo;s medical records/notes or on an administration form. (See section 5.2). <br /> All pharmacists administering vaccines under this PGD must have read and be fully aware of all points in the updated Chapter 2 on Consent within the DoH &ldquo;Green Book&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The key points include: -</p>
<ul>
<li>If a patient&rsquo;s fitness and suitability cannot be established, supply should be deferred.</li>
<li>There is no legal requirement for consent to be in writing but written consent serves to record the decision and the discussions that have taken place and that the patient or person with parental responsibility giving consent on a child&rsquo;s behalf has been informed about the process, benefits and risks of supply.</li>
<li>Consent - either written or verbal - is required at the time of each supply.</li>
<li>Consent remains valid unless the individual who gave it withdraws it. If there is new information between the time consent was given and when the supply is offered, including new evidence of risk, new medicines becoming available or where there is a significant change in the individual&rsquo;s condition, it may be necessary for the patient to reconfirm their consent.</li>
<li>Written and verbal information should be available in a form that can be easily understood by the person who will be giving the consent. Where English is not easily understood, translations and properly recognised interpreters should be used in order that they can make informed consent.</li>
<li>The bringing of a patient for the supply after an invitation to attend for this purpose may be viewed as acceptance that the patient may have the administration.</li>
<li>Individuals (patient, parent, guardian or person with parental responsibility) should also be informed about how data on the supply will be stored, who will be able to access that information and how that data may be used.</li>
<li>Where consent is either refused or withdrawn, this decision must be documented.</li>
<li>Consent obtained before the occasion upon which a patient is brought for the supply is only an agreement for the patient to be included in the administration programme and does not mean that consent is in place for each future administration.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>5.4 Audit </strong> <br />All health risk assessment, advice, medicine supply record and record of emergency management of anaphylaxis should be stored in the pharmacy or CQC registered business and will be audited by a line manager designated healthcare professional every year, in order to analyse service delivery. Upon reviewing the audit, if the service is deemed insufficient by the line auditor, Voyager Medical must be immediately notified and the CQC manager or superintendent pharmacist must informed. An action plan to remedy the insufficiencies will then be required to submit to the Voyager Medical medical team for analysis.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>6. Facilities and supplies to be available at sites for the administration of the drug specified in the PGD</strong> <br /> Consultations carried out under the authorisation of this PGD should be completed in a private space, physically closed off from interruption such as a pharmacy consultation room, so as to ensure patient confidentiality.</p>
<p>The following should be available at sites where the drug is to be administered: <br /> (i) Refrigerator (or validated cool boxes for storing vaccine if mobile unit).<br /> (ii) Access to medical support (this may be via telephone). <br /> (iii) Safe storage areas for medicines and equipment. <br /> (iv) Equipment for disposal of used materials i.e. waste bins.<br /> (v) Clean and tidy work areas. <br /> (vi) Copies of the current PGD for the drug specified in the PGD.<br /> (vii) Copies of the current protocol for the administration of adrenaline/epinephrine in cases of suspected hypersensitivity and/or anaphylactic reaction.<br /> (viii) Access to TRAVAX, <a href="http://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk">http://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk</a> or <a href="../traval-pgds/nathnac.org">nathnac.org </a><br /> (ix) Off-site administration of vaccines may be performed provided a risk assessment has been completed and suitable insurance has been obtained. The online vaccine training resources provided by Voyager Medical contains the official premises risk assessment form which should be completed in full.</p>
